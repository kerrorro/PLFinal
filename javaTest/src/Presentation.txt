- Created a file called ObjectFactory
- Object name is Employee
- Within employee we have closure f and run
- We run the closure f and assign it to run
- The closure f has data and cf (our getter and setter)
- data contains the datas of Employee object
- cf act as getter and setter for data



(exec 'import ObjectFactory;

employee = ObjectFactory.Employee();

employee.run("$firstName")("Fahran");

employee.run("$lastName")("Kamili");

employee.run("$title")("Software Engineer");

toReturn = employee.run("firstName") +
" " + employee.run("lastName") +
", " + employee.run("title")')

# TODO What to put in terminal
(exec 'import ObjectFactory; employee = ObjectFactory.Employee(); employee.run("$firstName")("Fahran"); employee.run("$lastName")("Kamili"); employee.run("$title")("Software Engineer"); toReturn = employee.run("firstName") + " " + employee.run("lastName") + ", " + employee.run("title")')

# TODO the AST
['exec', '\'import ObjectFactory; employee = ObjectFactory.Employee(); employee.run("$firstName")("Fahran"); employee.run("$lastName")("Kamili"); employee.run("$title")("Software Engineer"); toReturn = employee.run("firstName") + " " + employee.run("lastName") + ", " + employee.run("title")\'']
